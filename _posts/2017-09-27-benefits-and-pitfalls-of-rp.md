In this meetup I want to discuss how the RP paradigma helps handle states and data flow in web applications and I will share my experience, what typical problems you will face when implementing a (medium complex) web application based on RP principles. (like: handle form data/input, side effects, server-client synchronization, routing etc.)

I will give an introduction talk based on an application which uses Angular4 and the ngrx platform, but I would like to discuss the topic independent of framework-specific implementations.
