In 2009, the French Soitec Group aquired Concentrix, a spin-off company
of the Fraunhofer ISE in Freiburg and Soitec Solar GmbH was born.
Within the next 6 years the company has built many solar power plants all over
the world.

These power plants are working with CPV technology (concentrator photovoltaics)
and have been producing lots of time series data.
When I started at Soitec, this data was hardly accessible.

My job was to use it to monitor, optimize, and evaluate our installations -
and to enable others to do so. During this talk I would like to present some of
the challenges I faced and what kind of software I wrote to tackle them in a
dynamic environment.
