Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique to reuse client-side JavaScript code
on the server, mainly to speed up the initial "page load". It is considered one
of the most complicated features to implement in the JS ecosystem. Yet, web
applications with a high traffic often need it.

In this talk, I’ll start by introducing the concept of SSR and universal (or
isomorphic) applications. The second part of this presentation will be dedicated
to what I've learnt building the new [Mozilla Add-Ons
frontend](https://addons.mozilla.org).
