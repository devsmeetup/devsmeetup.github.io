JavaScript is everywhere - and so are its benefits and flaws.
Due to its dynamic type system, many errors are only discovered at runtime.
With TypeScript and Flow we already have tools to add type safety to JavaScript
in order to mitigate some of these issues. Recently, Reason (aka ReasonML)
has gained quite some attention especially in the React community, as it takes
static typing to another level through powerful language features coming from OCaml.
In this talk, we'll see when it makes sense to use types in JavaScript code
and how we can provide it with extra super powers via Reason's features.
