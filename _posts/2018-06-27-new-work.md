Five years ago I started this meetup with a couple of people. A lot has changed since then.
The way how development is done today is totally different from back then.
Wheather you look at Frontend development or the server-side. Libraries like React didn‘t exist
or were not in use in any project yet. HTML5 Boilerplate was still hot for frontend development.
Nowadays development is focused on tooling and automation.

Not only the way how we write code changed but also the way how we work together has changed.
Projects and companies changed. There has been a digital revolution and it is still going on.
What does this mean for us as developers? What will the state of development be in five more years?
