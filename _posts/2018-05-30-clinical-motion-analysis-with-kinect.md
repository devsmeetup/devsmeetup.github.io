Motognosis develops software for medical motion analysis based on consumer cameras
with 3D tracking (e.g. Microsoft Kinect, Intel RealSense).
We provide doctors with accurate and objective quantifications of
motor symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis.

I will give a short intro to the company and the motivation behind the system
and then talk about the technology and give a demo of our current research system for motion analysis.
