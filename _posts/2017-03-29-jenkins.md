Jenkins is a continuous integration and delivery software which serves you, but sometimes it's vice versa.

In this talk, I'll give you examples of the problems my team had with Jenkins while developing/maintaining eCommerce platform and sub products around it. I'll also share my experience how these issues were solved.
