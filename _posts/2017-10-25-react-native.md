Two years ago, Facebook open-sourced React Native, a framework to build native
mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It quickly became a game-changer and we
all use applications written with React Native (Airbnb, Instagram, Skype, etc.).

In this short talk (in English), I'll introduce the React and React Native
ecosystems and share my experience building a mobile application for Android and
iOS.
