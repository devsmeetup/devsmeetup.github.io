Hexagonal Architecture is a concept where the core of the application is
implemented independently from the infrastructure. Especially
business-critical applications benefit if the business logic does not
depend on e.g. databases, external services, or the full-stack framework
that is used. The code becomes easier to test, to extend, and to understand.

Connections to topics like Domain-Driven Design, or Test-Driven
Development are shown. Additionally we'll discuss how existing projects
can benefit from the shown concepts.
